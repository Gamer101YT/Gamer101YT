- 👋 Hi, I’m @Gamer101YT
- 👀 I’m interested in guitar, gaming, and of course coding!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on almost anything, as long as I know how to use the program.
- 📫 How to reach me: I'm sorry, but I dislike any form of social media and therefore the only way to contact me is through an account that will be linked.
- 😄 Pronouns: I'm a boy; that's all you need to know
- ⚡ Fun fact: I started coding when I was 7 years old! It was of course block coding but I've never stopped!!
